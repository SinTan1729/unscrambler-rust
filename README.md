# Unscrambler written in Rust

I'm learning Rust, so this is just a rewrite of an simple old project in Rust.

### Note

The main wordlist was pulled from [words_alpha.txt by dwyl](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/) and processed using Rust. Processing code was really simple, so didn't put it up here.
